          <p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport played between two 
            teamsof seven players, originating in ancient India.
          The objective of the game is for a single player on
          offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the
          opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many 
           their players as possible, and return to their own
          half of the court, all without being tackled by the
         defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player
          tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a
           point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of 
           the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to 
           the game after each point scored by their team from a tag 
           or tackle.It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other
         surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear
         in the history of India, the game was popularised as a competitive
          sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.

          <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a 
            shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with
            larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles"
            (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).
            Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or
             on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.
             Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and 
             landing it within the other team's half of the court.Each side may
             only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play
             ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a
             fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) 
             the opposing side.This game is known by numerous names in different
             parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or chedugudu in 
             Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and
